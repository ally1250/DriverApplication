# DriverApplication

### Purpose of this Repository
This repository is created to provide a structural preview of the application that is still under development. This repository contains selected sections of code copied from the original Driver Application repository. Therefore, the code in this repository cannot be successfully built. Sorry for the inconvenience and complication.

## Project Overview
### Problem Context
There are several Chinese restaurants offering takeaway meals to UCSD students with no delivery fee to provide more variety in food choices. To order a meal, students need to join a WeChat group where the restaurant shares an ordering link for each deal. In addition, since the link does not support any type of payment, students are responsible to complete the payment through a mobile application called Venmo. This workflow makes food ordering less flexible and accessible to students and also makes bookkeeping difficult for the restaurants. 

### Solution
Our project aims to improve the current food ordering system to make ordering and deliverying more convenient.
